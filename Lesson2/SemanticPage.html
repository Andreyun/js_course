		<h2>About this page</h2>
		<article>
			<p>You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. They were just sucked into space. Not if I weaken first. Computer, belay that order. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." I am your worst nightmare!</p>

			<p>We have a saboteur aboard. Your head is not an artifact! Mr. Crusher, ready a collision course with the Borg ship. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Ensign Babyface! I'll alert the crew. I'd like to think that I haven't changed those things, sir. Computer, belay that order. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. and attack the Romulans. Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. Talk about going nowhere fast. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy.</p>
